## Overview

In this workshop we will explore all of the interesting and variety ways you can use shiny: from adding dynamic elements to your existing RMarkdown / Quarto documents, to building and deploying dashboards for reporting, and customizing the appearance and themeing of the app (and your outplots like plots and tables). This workshop assumes that you have a basic familiarity with Shiny (e.g. the ability to write simple apps and basics of reactivety).

## This workshop is for you if

* have some experience with Shiny and want to improve your skills,

* are interested in building dashboards for reporting, and

* want to learn about styling and theming your dashboards.

Users who are new to Shiny will benefit from taking Getting Started with Shiny for R before joining this workshop.

## Prework

There is nothing you will need to do before attending this workshop. We will be making use of Posit Cloud for all activities and exercises so you will just need to bring a laptop that is able to access the conference WiFi.
