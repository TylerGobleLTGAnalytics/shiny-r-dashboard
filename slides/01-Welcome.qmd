# Computational Environment

## Posit Cloud

You can use the following link to join the workshops Posit Cloud space,

::: {.larger style="text-align: center; padding:0.5em; border:4px dashed goldenrod;"}
[bit.ly/conf2023_shiny_dashboard](https://bit.ly/conf2023_shiny_dashboard)
:::


Once you have joined you can then select the `shiny-dashboard` assignment, 

![](images/cloud_assignment.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

This creates a copy of all materials and launches a cloud session for you.


## Cloud session

If everything is working you should see something very close to the following,

![](images/cloud_session.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}


## File organization

Project root:

* `slides/` - all slides and related materials

* `demos/` - sample code for each demo

* `exercises/` -  starter code for each exercise

* `exercises/solutions/` - sample solution code for each exercise 

* `data/` - example data sets used in demos and exercises


# A starting point

## Data

```{r}
#| code-overflow: scroll
(d = read_csv("data/weather.csv"))
```


## Demo 01 - A starter app

::: {.code-file .sourceCode .cell-code}
`r fontawesome::fa("file")` `demos/demo01.R`
:::
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| file: "demos/demo01.R"
```

## Your turn - Exercise 01

Using the code in `exercises/ex01.R` (same as the previous slide) try running the app in Posit cloud.

Check that you are able successfully run the shiny app and are able to interact with it. 

If everything is working try modifying the code:

- Can you rearrange the elements of the `mainPanel()` to make things more readable?

- What would we need to change to allow for multiple cities to be selected and visualized?
