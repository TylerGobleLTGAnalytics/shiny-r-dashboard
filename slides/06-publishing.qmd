# Deploying Shiny apps

## shinyapps.io

If you have not done so already - go to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and sign up for an account.

* You can create a new account via email & a password

* or via o-auth through Google or GitHub.

If asked to pick a plan, use the Free option (more than sufficient for our needs here)

## Organizing your app

For deployment generally apps will be organized as a single folder that contains all the necessary components (R script(s), data files, other static content).

* Pay attention to the nature of any paths used in your code 

  * Absolute paths are almost certainly going to break
  
  * Relative paths should be to the root of the app folder
  
* Static files (e.g. css, js, images, etc.) generally are placed in the `www/` subfolder

* Your script *does not* need to be named `app.R` or `ui.R`/`server.R`

* Check / think about package dependencies


## Your turn - Exercise 06

Now we will publish one of the demo apps to shinyapps.io (or posit.cloud)

1. Pick your favorite demo or exercise from today and package it up either as an app in `exercises/ex06app` (you will need to create this folder)
    - Make sure to copy the data (`data/weather.csv`) into this folder
    - and adjust any paths if necessary
  
2. Open the script file in `exercises/ex06app` and click the Publish Document button in the upper right of the pane (look for the ![](images/publish_button.png) icon)

    - You should be presented with the "Publish to server", click on the Add New Account link in the upper right
    
    - Select shinyapps.io and follow the instructions to connect
    
    - When retrieving your token for shinyapps.io you may need to click `Dashboard` first and then your name (both in the upper right)
    
    
::: aside
If you took part in the Getting Started with Shiny workshop yesterday you can try publishing to posit.cloud instead, the option should be prepopulated on the "Publish to server" dialog.

## Your turn - Exercise 06 (cont.)

3. Once authenticated you should be back at the "Publish to server" dialog, use this to select which files to include (select your script and data file)

4. Your Shiny app should now be deploying and should open on shinyapps.io once live - check to see if everything works, if not go back and check Steps 1 and 3.


```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(10)
```


## Other publishing options

- For other R users - you can share your script(s) and data directly 

  - or better yet, bundle them into an R package
  
- Run a local instance of [shiny server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/)

- Use shinyapps.io (public) or posit.cloud (within team)

- License Posit Connect
